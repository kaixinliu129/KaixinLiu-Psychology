        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Kaixin Liu and I am a first year Psychology major. I am planning to minor in applied statistics in the upcoming school year of Fall 2020. I enjoy drawing in my freetime and I use it as a way to build up a stronger endurance for my patience. Another hobby of mine would be reading because I love the places that the book itself would take me to. I am currently not working; however, I used to be a tutor for kids ranging from Kindergarten to Sixth grade. I was able to land this opportunity through a program I had joined in highschool called the Teacher Preparation Academy. After four years of being in this program, I have learned many experiences through my interactions with kids younger than me. Tutoring strengthened my communication skills and my ability to remain calm while in the face of an unexpected situation. 

<br><br>

        Besides my program, I also held a position as a secretary for 2 consecutive years in Key Club. Being in a leadership role taught me to become more responsible and hold a more positive mindset. There has always been this stigma that Key Club is just for Asians; however, we do not have many Asians in my school. As a result, my board and I would try to recruit other members who are not Asian to show that our club welcomes and encourages diversity. There was one thing that I had learned through that and it was to be hopeful that my club will slowly grow. I realized that even though our club may attract a lot of people in one go, it is not guaranteed in the long run. Hence, my fellow board members and I would try to encourage members to run for leadership positions by being transparent with all the information to help them feel more confident about stepping up. Many members decided to stay because my board and I made sure to make them feel included in events and activities that our club hosted. In addition, we made sure to go the extra step to build connections with the members. As a result, the members felt as if they were a part of our community and were motivated to stay within the club. <br><br>

        Due to how much I liked being in Key Club, I decided to encourage myself to also join Circle K, which is the college version of Key Club. I ended up applying for a position in Circle K to further my involvement in the club and as a way to gain more leadership experiences. I wanted to use this chance as a way to also get out of my own comfort zone and experience something new. Another extracurricular that I took a part in was tennis. At first, I joined because of my friend. However, I grew to love the sport itself. I believe in enjoying the little things in life because one may just find life in a much more positive perspective.
